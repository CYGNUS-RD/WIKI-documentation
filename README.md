# WIKI-documentation
repository to host the WIKI pages for all the CYGNO activities

The documentation is organized as follows:
- a HOME page with links to all the wiki pages of the different activities (Fabrizio volunteers to keep it in good shape...)
- a wiki page for each activity that needs it (each page should have a responsible that periodically check and updates the content)
